# Concurrent Programming in Go
This repository holds codes of concurrent programming tools like mutexs, semaphores, wait groups, etc.

## Mutexes
Mutexes make access to shared memory synchronous while modifying them. Thus blocking concurrency when modifying the shared resources and preventing race conditions.
